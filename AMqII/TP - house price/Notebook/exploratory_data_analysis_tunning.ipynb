When a value is missing for the basement, all features associated with that house's basement are missing as well, possibly because that house didn't have a basement. The same occurs with the features associated with the garage.\n","\n","\t- Some features are highly imbalanced, for example, `street`, where 96.2% of the samples have the value _`pave`_.\n","\n","* **Garage features:**\n","\t- Some features have 5.5% missing values, but this might be associated with what was mentioned earlier.\n","\n","\t- `GarageArea` has 5.5% zeros, which aligns with the hypothesis that these may be houses without garages.\n","\n","\t- `GarageQual` and `GarageCond` are imbalanced, with more than 85% of their samples being similar.\n","\n","\t- Several features like `GarageQual` and `GarageCond` exhibit high correlation. **In a subsequent analysis, this should be studied in more detail to avoid collinearity between the resulting dataset`s variables.** The same applies to `GarageCars` and `GarageArea.`\n","\n","* **Basement features:**\n","\t- Some columns have a large number of zeros, for example, `BsmtFinSF1` and `BsmtFinSF2.` This may be associated with houses not having basements. Further examination should ensure data consistency, for instance, verifying that houses with 0 square meters of `Bsmt2` do not have a high-quality label for that same space.\n","\n","\t- Most numerical features in this group have positively skewed distributions. For example, `TotalBsmtSF` has a positive skew. Normalization may be considered later.\n","\n","\t- The characteristics `BsmtFinSF1` and `BsmtUnfSF` exhibit high correlation, so attention should be given to avoiding collinearity between variables.\n","\n","* **Lot features:**\n","\t- Similar to the previous groups, numerical variable distributions are positively skewed.\n","\n","\t- The variable `LotFrontage` has a considerable number of missing values (17.7%). Nevertheless, the rest of the variables do not have missing data, so they could be used for imputing the missing data in the remaining variable.\n","\n","\t- `LotFrontage` and `LotArea` features display a high correlation.
